/**
@page testing Testing Firmware


Every different module was tested separately, 
eater with the debugger function of the STM32CubeIDE or with the Cable Monitor device itself. 
@n Additionally, Matlab was used to double-check the output data from the FFT and 
the positions calculations were checked with GeoGebra and VS-code.
@n
@n All the existing module where then merged together and tested again, if they would work as expected.
